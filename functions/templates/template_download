# Package Download Function Template
#
# most of this template is complete, you'll just need to change the three variables:
#
#	package_name = the name of the downloaded package you'll be installing
#	app_name = a human readable name of the app you're installing
#	package_version = version number of the package, if applicable, usually formatted as '1.2.3'
#
# and replace 'https://download.example.com/packages/linux/' with an actual link to remote packages
#
# next set the 'function_name' and reference it in the 'thirdparty' function
# in the 'thirdparty' function file and be sure to 'source' it in the list at the top of that file as well
